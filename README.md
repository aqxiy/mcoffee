Modern Coffee

Observe that it may behave better once passively cooled 20 minutes (begins after final 5 minute wait) then covered with folded over paper towel & small ceramic plate atop, and refrigerated for 10-12 hours. For near-immediate results, and/or for warm coffee, try a 21 minute total wait post final stir, and pour off about 100 mL into a separate cup for drinking. Maybe best after a meal 30-45 minutes prior. 

1. Fill 50mL beaker with 30 mL of cold filtered water (from freezer unit) & add 20 mL distilled white vinegar. Wait 30 seconds.
2. Pour beaker into coffee mug, then follow with 4 more beakers. Let sit 5 minutes.
3. Add 14 mL Apple Cider Vinegar (measure with 1 mL syringe). Wait 3 minutes from finish of prior.
4. Add Coffee 1 tbsp (Nescafe Taster’s Cafe House Blend light-medium Instant Coffee). Pour onto measuring tablespoon, then onto small plate, off which coffee enters cup liquid (for better dispersion; you want a nice, even coat across the surface). Let sit 4 minutes.
5. Microwave @ power level 5 for 3 minutes (Output power 1100W, 10 power levels; 1-10). Leave 15 seconds in microwave post finish.
6. After 5 seconds steady on level surface, stir CW with small tablespoon for 30 seconds. Once done, wait 40 seconds. Then stir as before. Each time remove spoon after stirring. Now wait 2.5 min.
7. Add 10 raisins. Wait 3 minutes. Stir 30 seconds. Wait 5 minutes.
8. Drink.
